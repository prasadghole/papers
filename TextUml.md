This paper compares GUI based drawing tools with text based tools used for creating UML diagrams.

UML has become de-facto standard for software modelling covering all aspects of software development. Various
proprietary tools are in the market like Microsoft Visio , enterprise architecture , IBM rational.

These proprietary tools have their own binary format and provide various export options to convert these images in 
image format. These exported images then can be embed in software documents.
Due proprietary format maintaining version control and seeing difference also need support from tool vendor. 
Text based modelling tools are alternative to these drawing based tools and provide following advantages
1. Text is natural language in which developers communicate with computer. Having text based tool to describes modelling
of software make it more convenient to express software models.
2. Version control tools used for maintaining version of source code can be used.
3. Text description in most of case have similar semantics for Modelling and source code.
4. Generic ascii text editor can be used for authoring models.
5. Provide same or more export options compared to proprietary tools.
6. Most of tools are open source hence saves licensing cost.

Some disadvantages compared to proprietary tools are
1. Less grid level control on placement of graphical widgets in generated output.
2. Less flexible for diagram consisting more number of graphical symbols or widgets. 

Examples
1. Plantuml

Text based modelling tools are cost effective and more expressive options available for software modelling.
